  generate and update GitHub's CODEOWNERS file based on the git fame of files
inputs:
  distribution:
    description: |
      The distribution input defines the minimum percentage of code lines that are required for a contributor to being
      considered a code owner.
      Set it to any integer without the percent character to override the default.
    required: false
    default: '25'
  path:
    description: |
      This defines the path to the CODEOWNERS file.
      The default uses the path to the `.github` directory.
    required: false
    default: '.github/CODEOWNERS'
  granular:
    description: |
      By default, this action checks all files in the root, but groups recursive files into their parent directories.
      Set this input to any non-zero value (e.g. `true`) to enable full coverage of all recursive files.
    required: false
    default: ''
  username:
    description: |
      By default, this action uses the email addresses of users.
      Set this input to any non-zero value (e.g. `true`) to derive the GitHub usernames and use them instead.
    required: false
    default: ''
  token:
    description: |
      A GitHub token has to be set if `inputs.username` is enabled.
      This is necessary because the GitHub API has a rate limit.
      The default token has sufficient permissions for the API.
    required: false
    default: ${{ github.token }}
